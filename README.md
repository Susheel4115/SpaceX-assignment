# Credits
This project was created by <b>Susheel Kumar</b> for the assignment purpose. The SpaceX API was used to retrieve data on SpaceX launches.The SpaceX Launches page was used as design inspiration for the project.
 I have research regarding the what template I have to use I was intially confused to go with vite,next cra or plain cra template
 Tried with vite and next.js templates but little ambiguity in that situations so I shifted back to typescript create-react-app
 I have used native fetch method to consume the data from API endpoint.
 Coming to styling of the application I have used MaterialUI and plain css for few components.
 Node version : ```v18.14.0```
